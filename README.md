## Summary
- Drawback of the webpage
First and foremost drawback is user can't select the items from filter section that he/she wants to go for. One should know what they want to find or search on UFO webpage while using filter option. 
- Recommendations
1. Dana and her team can add options under filter section for the user to choose from. This will make functionality of filter and table of UFO sighting more advanced and vast variety of audience can visit UFO webpage for collecting information without any prior knowledge about ufology. 
2. Webpage can get edited more nicely and precisely. Space between table and description can be reduced and precise details about what table is about and how data can be useful for user need to be explained on webpage.
